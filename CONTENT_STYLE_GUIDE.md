# Diabol AI Blog - Content Style Guide

This guide defines the structure and formatting conventions for all blog posts. Follow this structure to ensure consistency, SEO optimization, and AI visibility.

---

## Post Structure Overview

Every blog post should follow this structure (top to bottom):

```
1. Title (H1)
2. Direct Answer (1-2 sentences, italicized)
3. TL;DR (3-5 bullet points)
4. Table of Contents (auto-generated from headings)
5. Main Content Sections (H2 headings)
6. FAQ Section (H2 with H3 question subheadings)
7. Further Reading & Essential Resources (H2)
8. Conclusion/CTA paragraph
```

---

## 1. Title

- **Format:** Statement-based, not a question
- **Length:** 50-60 characters ideal for SEO
- **Style:** Clear, specific, includes primary keyword

### Examples:
| Good | Avoid |
|------|-------|
| "Why SMBs Should Prioritize AI Voice Now" | "Should You Use AI Voice?" |
| "The Complete Guide to AI Search Optimization" | "What is AI Search?" |
| "5 Ways Voice AI Reduces Operational Costs" | "Can Voice AI Save Money?" |

---

## 2. Direct Answer

The first paragraph after the title. This directly answers the main question/topic for AI systems and impatient readers.

- **Format:** 1-2 sentences, italicized
- **Purpose:** Gives AI systems a clear, quotable answer
- **Placement:** Immediately after title, before TL;DR

### Example:
> *You should prioritize AI voice because it delivers immediate ROI by capturing missed calls worth $6,000+ annually, while forcing operational clarity that prepares your business for broader AI transformation.*

---

## 3. TL;DR Section

A scannable summary of key points for readers who want the highlights.

- **Format:** Bulleted list, 3-5 points
- **Heading:** Use "TL;DR" as the heading
- **Style:** Each bullet is a complete, standalone insight
- **Length:** Each bullet 1-2 sentences max

### Example:
```markdown
## TL;DR

- Small businesses miss up to 40% of calls during peak hours, losing $6,000+ annually in revenue
- Voice AI creates a diagnostic tool that reveals every operational weakness in your business
- The competitive window is closing fast—22% of SMBs have implemented voice AI
- Start narrow with one high-volume use case, then scale after proving results
```

## 4. Main Content Sections

The body of your article, organized under H2 headings.

### Heading Conventions:

| Level | Use For | Style |
|-------|---------|-------|
| H2 | Main sections | Statement-based, numbered if sequential |
| H3 | Subsections | Can be questions or statements |
| H4 | Sub-subsections (rare) | Use sparingly |

### Main Section Heading Examples:
```markdown
## 1. Why Voice AI Matters for SMBs
## 2. The Hidden Cost of Missed Calls
## 3. How to Implement Voice AI Step-by-Step
## 4. Measuring ROI and Success Metrics
```

### Content Guidelines:
- Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Include data, statistics, and specific examples
- Add internal links to related Diabol AI content
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for scanability
- Include images/diagrams where helpful

---

## 5. FAQ Section

Frequently asked questions that address common reader queries. These help with SEO and AI visibility.

- **Heading:** `## Frequently Asked Questions`
- **Questions:** Each as an H3, phrased as actual questions
- **Answers:** 2-4 sentences, direct and helpful
- **Count:** 3-6 questions per post

### Example:
```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does "AI visibility" mean?
AI visibility refers to how often and prominently your brand appears in AI-generated answers from tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews. Unlike traditional SEO rankings, AI visibility depends on being cited as an authoritative source.

### How is AI search optimization different from regular SEO?
Traditional SEO focuses on ranking in link-based search results. AI search optimization focuses on being cited in AI-generated answers, which requires clear, authoritative content that AI systems can parse and quote.

### How long does it take to see results from voice AI?
Most businesses see measurable results within 2-4 weeks of implementation. Initial metrics include call capture rate, response accuracy, and customer satisfaction scores.
