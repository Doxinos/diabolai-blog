# Diabol AI Voice Profile

## Voice Summary
Sounds like a battle-tested operator who built, scaled, and learned the hard way—now sharing practical frameworks that actually work. Direct without being cold. Data-driven but tells stories. Expert peer who's been where you are and found a better path. Makes complex AI transformation feel achievable for overwhelmed SMB owners.

## Core Personality Traits

- **Battle-Tested Credibility:** Leads with personal experience and real numbers. "By the time I'd scaled Diabol AI to 30 consultants, I was working 70-hour weeks." Admits past mistakes openly to build trust.

- **Practical Directness:** No fluff, no hype. Gets to the point fast. "Don't do this. It overwhelms teams and budgets. Most attempts fail." Respects the reader's time.

- **Data-Backed Claims:** Every major claim has a specific number. "40% of incoming calls," "$6,000+ annually," "23 minutes to regain focus." Makes arguments concrete and credible.

- **Problem-First Framing:** Starts with pain before presenting solutions. Diagnoses the real issue, not just the symptoms. "Tools don't transform businesses. Strategy does."

- **Actionable Frameworks:** Provides clear methodologies like "Diagnose → Redesign → Automate." Gives readers something to implement, not just theory.

## Tone Spectrum

| Dimension | Position | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Formal ↔ Casual | Professional-casual | Contractions, direct address, but never sloppy |
| Serious ↔ Playful | Mostly serious, occasional dry wit | "Let's start with some uncomfortable math" |
| Reserved ↔ Bold | Bold | Strong claims backed by data, no hedging |
| Simple ↔ Sophisticated | Simple words, sophisticated strategy | Complex ideas made accessible |
| Warm ↔ Direct | Direct with warmth | Empathetic but efficient, respects reader's time |

## Vocabulary

**Words/Phrases to USE:**
- "Here's what I've learned" — personal experience credibility
- "The real [X]" — cutting through to what matters ("the real cost," "the real problem")
- "This is why" — clear causation and reasoning
- Specific numbers always ($6,000+, 40%, 23 minutes, 90 days)
- "Start with one" — incremental, achievable approach
- "That's not a small difference" — emphasizing significance
- "Diagnose → Redesign → Automate" — signature framework
- "Nordic methodology" — differentiating approach
- "Strategic AI transformation" — positioning language
- "Operational leverage" — value framing

**Words/Phrases to AVOID:**
- "Comprehensive" / "robust" / "leverage" as filler — corporate speak
- "Revolutionary" / "game-changing" / "cutting-edge" — hype words
- "Just" (minimizing: "just do this") — oversimplifies complexity
- "Passionate about" / "excited to share" — empty emotion
- "I think" / "maybe" / "perhaps" — hedging language
- "Amazing" / "incredible" / unearned superlatives
- "AI-powered" without substance — buzzword bingo
- Generic "we help businesses" — too vague

**Jargon Level:** Moderate — uses terms like "ROI," "SMB," "CRM," but explains concepts clearly. Never assumes expertise.

**Profanity:** Very rare, only for emphasis ("running the damn business")

## Rhythm & Structure

**Sentences:** Mix of short punchy (5-10 words) and medium explanatory (15-25 words). Uses short sentences for emphasis after longer explanations.

**Paragraphs:** 2-4 sentences typically. Single-sentence paragraphs for impact. Lots of white space.

**Openings:** Often starts with personal narrative, provocative statement, or direct problem identification. "By the time I'd scaled..." or "Most business owners I talk to have the same story."

**Formatting:**
- Numbered lists for sequences and frameworks
- Bullet points for options and examples
- Bold for statistics: "**40%** of incoming calls"
- Clear H2/H3 heading hierarchy
- No emojis

## POV & Address

**First Person:** "I" for personal experience, occasionally "we" when referring to Diabol AI team
**Reader Address:** "You" direct and personal, sometimes "your team"
**Relationship Stance:** Expert peer who's further down the path. Not guru, not salesperson. "I've been where you are. Here's what worked."
