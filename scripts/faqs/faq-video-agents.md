## Frequently Asked Questions

### How good is AI-generated video quality right now?

It's crossed the "good enough" threshold for most business content. Talking-head videos with AI avatars (like HeyGen) are nearly indistinguishable from real footage at 1080p. Where quality still falls short is complex movements, hand gestures, and multi-person scenes. For explainer videos, product demos, and social clips — which is 80% of what businesses need — the output is production-ready today.

### How much does AI video production cost compared to traditional production?

A traditional 2-minute explainer video runs $3,000-$10,000 when you factor in scripting, filming, editing, and talent. The same video produced with AI tools costs $50-$200 in API fees plus 2-4 hours of setup time. At scale, the difference is even more dramatic — producing 20 videos per month with AI costs roughly what one traditional video costs. The tradeoff is creative flexibility; AI videos work best with structured, repeatable formats.

### How fast can AI generate a finished video?

A 60-second social clip takes about 10-15 minutes from script to final render. A full 5-10 minute explainer takes 30-60 minutes. Compare that to 2-4 weeks for traditional production. The bottleneck isn't rendering anymore — it's script quality. Spend your time writing a strong script and the production side handles itself.

### Will audiences actually watch AI-generated videos?

Engagement data says yes, with caveats. AI avatar videos on YouTube and LinkedIn see comparable view-through rates to traditional talking-head content when the script is strong. Audiences care far more about whether the content solves their problem than how it was produced. That said, be transparent — disclose that AI was used. Trying to pass AI video off as human-filmed backfires when people figure it out.

### Can I repurpose blog posts into videos automatically?

Yes, and this is one of the highest-ROI applications. A well-structured blog post already has the ingredients: the headline becomes the hook, the TL;DR becomes key points, and the body sections become narration. We've built pipelines that take a published blog post and produce a 60-second short-form clip and a 5-10 minute explainer from the same content, with minimal manual intervention.
