## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the ROI timeline for deploying AI voice agents?

Most businesses see measurable ROI within 30-60 days of going live. The quickest wins come from after-hours call capture — if you're missing 30-40% of inbound calls (which is the average for SMBs), an AI agent starts recovering that revenue on day one. Full payback on setup costs typically happens within 2-3 months, assuming a reasonable call volume of 200+ calls per month.

### How much revenue are missed calls actually costing my business?

More than you think. Industry data shows the average missed business call is worth $100-$200 in potential revenue for service businesses. If you're missing 15-20 calls per week, that's $6,000-$16,000 per month walking out the door. For high-ticket services like HVAC, legal, or medical practices, a single missed call can represent $500-$2,000 in lost revenue. The math gets uncomfortable fast.

### Is AI voice technology difficult to implement?

It's simpler than most people expect. A basic AI receptionist that handles appointment booking and FAQs can go live in 1-2 weeks. A more complex agent with CRM integration, custom logic, and multi-step workflows takes 4-6 weeks. You don't need to rip out your existing phone system — most solutions layer on top of what you already have via call forwarding or SIP trunking.

### Do customers actually accept talking to AI on the phone?

Acceptance rates are higher than the headlines suggest. Studies show 65-70% of callers are comfortable interacting with AI for routine tasks like scheduling, status checks, and basic questions. The key factor isn't whether it's AI — it's whether the call gets resolved. When AI agents solve the problem quickly, satisfaction scores are within 5-10% of human agents. When they don't, frustration spikes fast. Build for resolution, not just conversation.

### How long is the competitive window for early AI voice adopters?

It's narrowing quickly. Right now, fewer than 10% of SMBs have deployed AI voice agents, which means early movers have a real advantage in response time and availability. Within 18-24 months, AI voice will be table stakes for any customer-facing business. The companies deploying now are building institutional knowledge — learning what works, refining their prompts, training their systems on real call data. That head start compounds over time and gets harder to replicate.
