## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between using AI tools and having an AI strategy?

Using AI tools is tactical — you grab ChatGPT, write some emails, maybe automate a report. An AI strategy is structural — it identifies which business processes benefit most from AI, sequences the implementation, and measures impact against specific KPIs. The difference shows up in results: companies with a strategy see 3-5x more productivity gains than those just experimenting with individual tools.

### How much does AI transformation actually cost for a small business?

It varies widely, but a realistic starting budget is $1,000-$3,000/month for a meaningful implementation. That covers tool subscriptions ($200-$500), integration work ($500-$1,500 one-time), and ongoing optimization. The mistake most SMBs make is either spending too little (grabbing free tiers that don't solve real problems) or too much (buying enterprise platforms they'll never fully use). Start with one high-impact workflow and expand from there.

### Where should an SMB start with AI implementation?

Start where the pain is highest and the process is most repetitive. For most SMBs, that's one of three areas: customer communication (missed calls, slow email responses), content creation (marketing that never gets done), or data entry and reporting (hours spent on spreadsheets). Pick the area where you're losing the most time or revenue, prove the ROI there, then reinvest those savings into the next implementation.

### What are the most common mistakes SMBs make with AI?

The top three: First, trying to automate everything at once instead of focusing on one workflow. Second, skipping the data cleanup — AI is only as good as the data it works with, and most SMBs have messy CRMs and inconsistent processes. Third, not assigning an internal owner. Someone needs to monitor outputs, refine prompts, and manage the tools. AI isn't "set it and forget it" — it's "set it, monitor it, improve it."

### How long until we see real results from an AI implementation?

For a focused implementation (one workflow, clear metrics), expect to see measurable results in 30-60 days. Full organizational impact — where AI is embedded across multiple processes and the team has adapted their workflows — takes 6-12 months. The companies that move fastest are the ones that start small, prove value quickly, and use that momentum to fund the next phase. Trying to boil the ocean on day one is the surest way to stall out.
