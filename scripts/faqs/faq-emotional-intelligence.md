## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does an AI voice agent detect caller emotions?

It uses a combination of acoustic analysis and natural language processing. The acoustic side measures pitch variation, speaking pace, volume changes, and pause patterns. The NLP side analyzes word choice, sentence structure, and conversational context. Together, these signals let the agent estimate whether a caller is frustrated, confused, interested, or ready to buy — with about 75-85% accuracy on current models.

### Does emotional intelligence in AI actually improve conversion rates?

The data says yes. Agents with sentiment-aware responses see 15-25% higher conversion rates on sales calls compared to scripted-only agents. The biggest gains come from de-escalation — when an AI detects frustration and adjusts its tone and pacing, call abandonment drops significantly. It's not magic; it's just responding appropriately to what the caller is actually feeling.

### When should an AI agent hand off to a human?

Set clear escalation thresholds. The most effective triggers are: sustained negative sentiment for more than 60 seconds, explicit requests to speak with a person, high-value deals above your defined threshold, and complex multi-issue complaints. The handoff itself matters as much as the trigger — the human agent should receive a full conversation summary and sentiment timeline so the caller doesn't have to repeat themselves.

### What are the current limitations of AI emotional intelligence?

Sarcasm is still a weak spot — most models misread it about 40% of the time. Cultural differences in emotional expression also cause accuracy drops, especially across languages. Background noise degrades acoustic analysis. And the AI can't read body language, obviously, which removes a major input channel. These limitations are real, but for phone-based interactions where you're working with voice alone, the technology is useful enough to deploy today.

### Does this technology feel creepy to callers?

Most callers don't realize the sentiment analysis is happening — it's invisible. What they notice is that the agent responds well: it slows down when they're confused, it softens when they're upset, it moves efficiently when they're in a hurry. In post-call surveys, callers rate sentiment-aware agents 20-30% higher on satisfaction than standard AI agents. People don't care how it works; they care that it works.
