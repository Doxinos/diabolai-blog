## Frequently Asked Questions

### What exactly is an AI clone, and how does it work?

An AI clone is a digital replica trained on your voice, communication style, and domain knowledge. It can handle phone calls, respond to messages, or create content that sounds like you. The technology combines voice cloning (for sound) with large language models (for reasoning), so the clone doesn't just mimic your voice — it thinks through problems the way you would.

### How much does an AI clone cost compared to hiring someone?

A well-built AI clone runs between $500 and $2,000/month in platform and API costs, depending on call volume. Compare that to a full-time employee at $4,000-6,000/month including benefits and overhead. The clone also works 24/7, doesn't call in sick, and can handle 50+ simultaneous conversations. For repetitive tasks like appointment scheduling or lead qualification, the math isn't close.

### How long does it take to set up an AI clone?

A basic clone with voice matching and scripted workflows takes 1-2 weeks. A more sophisticated version that handles nuanced conversations and integrates with your systems takes 4-6 weeks. The voice cloning itself only needs about 30 minutes of sample audio. The real time investment is in mapping out conversation flows and edge cases.

### Will customers know they're talking to an AI clone?

Some will, some won't. Voice quality has gotten remarkably good — most people can't distinguish a well-tuned clone in the first 30 seconds. That said, transparency matters both legally and ethically. We recommend disclosing that callers are speaking with an AI assistant. Interestingly, most callers don't care as long as their problem gets solved quickly.

### Are there legal risks with using AI clones for business?

Yes, and you need to take them seriously. Several states now require disclosure when callers are interacting with AI. You also need proper consent from anyone whose voice or likeness you're cloning — that means written agreements, not verbal handshakes. The regulatory landscape is evolving fast, so build your consent framework now before the rules tighten further.
