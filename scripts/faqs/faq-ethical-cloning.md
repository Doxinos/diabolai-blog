## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between ethical AI cloning and deepfakes?

Intent and consent. Deepfakes are created without the subject's knowledge or permission, usually to deceive. Ethical AI cloning starts with explicit written consent from the person being cloned, operates transparently (recipients know they're interacting with AI), and serves a legitimate business purpose. The underlying technology overlaps, but the governance framework around it is completely different.

### What legal frameworks apply to AI cloning right now?

The legal landscape is fragmented. The EU AI Act classifies certain cloning applications as high-risk, requiring transparency and human oversight. In the US, about 15 states have laws addressing synthetic media, with California and Texas leading on disclosure requirements. Federal regulation is still catching up. The safest approach: build consent documentation that exceeds current requirements, because the rules are only going to get stricter.

### How are enterprises actually using ethical AI clones?

The most common use cases are executive communication scaling (a CEO clone that handles routine video messages), customer service agents trained on company expertise, and internal training simulations. One pattern we see working well: founders clone themselves for sales qualification calls so leads get a consistent experience without burning founder time. Companies using clones for these purposes report 30-40% time savings on repetitive communication tasks.

### How do I protect my brand when deploying AI clones?

Start with guardrails, not speed. Define exactly what the clone can and can't say — build a topic blacklist and response boundaries before you launch. Monitor outputs with automated quality checks, not just spot-checking. Have a human review loop for any high-stakes interactions. And always include a disclosure that the interaction involves AI. One brand incident can undo months of trust-building.

### What consent framework should we put in place before cloning anyone?

You need three layers. First, explicit written consent from the person being cloned, specifying exactly how their likeness and voice will be used. Second, disclosure to anyone interacting with the clone — they need to know it's AI. Third, a revocation process so the cloned person can withdraw consent and have their clone deactivated within a defined timeframe (we recommend 72 hours max). Document everything and have legal review the framework before you deploy.
