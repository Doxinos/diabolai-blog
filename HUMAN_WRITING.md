# Human Writing Skill

## Purpose
Universal rules for writing that sounds authentically human, not AI-generated. Apply these rules to ALL written content regardless of platform, brand, or purpose.

## When to Use This Skill
- Always. Before any other writing skill.
- This is the foundation layer that applies to everything.

## Anti-AI Patterns (NEVER USE)

### Structural Giveaways

**Asyndetic Lists** (adjectives without conjunctions)
- "Fast, reliable, efficient"
- "Simple, powerful, intuitive"
- Instead: "It's fast and actually reliable"
- Instead: "Simple but surprisingly powerful"

**Tricolons** (three-part dramatic structures)
- "Build. Launch. Scale."
- "Think. Create. Succeed."
- "Learn. Grow. Lead."
- Instead: Just say what you mean in a normal sentence

**Anaphora** (repetitive sentence starts)
- "This is about growth. This is about freedom. This is about you."
- "We believe in quality. We believe in service. We believe in results."
- Instead: Vary your sentence openings naturally

**Forced Alliteration**
- "Powerful, productive, and profitable"
- "Better business breakthroughs"
- Instead: Only use alliteration if it happens naturally

**Em Dash Dramatic Contrast**
- "This isn't a tool—it's a revolution"
- "We don't sell software—we sell freedom"
- Instead: "It's more than a tool. It actually changes how you work."

**The "X aren't Y, they're Z" Formula**
- "Our clients aren't customers, they're partners"
- "These aren't features, they're superpowers"
- Instead: Just describe what it actually is

### Word-Level Giveaways

**Hollow Intensifiers**
- AVOID: truly, incredibly, absolutely, extremely, remarkably, exceptionally
- Instead: Use specific details: "cut 4 hours" beats "incredibly efficient"

**AI Buzzwords**
- AVOID: game-changing, revolutionary, cutting-edge, next-level, world-class
- AVOID: unlock (your potential), leverage (opportunities), optimize (everything)
- AVOID: seamless, frictionless, effortless
- AVOID: empower, elevate, transform
- Instead: Use plain words: help, use, improve, change

**Filler Phrases**
- AVOID: "In today's fast-paced world..."
- AVOID: "Now more than ever..."
- AVOID: "At the end of the day..."
- AVOID: "It goes without saying..."
- Instead: Just start with your actual point

**Over-Qualification**
- AVOID: "I would argue that..."
- AVOID: "It's worth noting that..."
- AVOID: "Interestingly enough..."
- Instead: Just state the thing

## Human Writing Patterns (DO USE)

### Sentence Variety

**Mix Lengths**
- Short sentences punch. They create rhythm.
- Then follow with something longer that develops the thought and gives it context.
- Avoid three sentences of identical length in a row.

**Vary Openings**
Don't start consecutive sentences with:
- The same word
- The same structure (Subject-verb-object, subject-verb-object)
- "I" repeatedly

**Use Conjunctions to Start**
- "And that's the thing..."
- "But here's what nobody mentions..."
- "So I tried something different."

### Natural Rhythm

**Read It Aloud**
If you stumble reading it, rewrite it. Human writing flows when spoken.

**The Coffee Test**
Would you say this to a friend over coffee? If it sounds weird out loud, it's too formal or too "written."

**Contractions Are Normal**
- USE: "I didn't think it would work"
- AVOID: "I did not think it would work" (unless emphasizing)

### Specificity Over Generality

**Concrete Details**
- AVOID: "Significant time savings"
- USE: "Saved me about 4 hours last week"

**Real Examples**
- AVOID: "Many businesses struggle with this"
- USE: "Last month, a plumber in Austin told me..."

**Numbers When Possible**
- AVOID: "Dramatically increased conversions"
- USE: "Went from 12% to 31% conversion"

### Imperfection Signals

**Hedging (occasional, authentic)**
- "I think" / "I'm not sure, but..."
- "At least in my experience..."
- "This might not work for everyone, but..."

**Self-Correction**
- "Well, actually—let me rephrase that."
- "That's not quite right. What I mean is..."

**Incomplete Thoughts (sparingly)**
- "The thing is..."
- "You know what I mean?"

## Structure Guidelines

### Paragraphs
- One idea per paragraph
- 1-4 sentences max for most content
- Longer paragraphs okay for deep explanations

### Lists
- Use sparingly—not everything needs bullets
- If you use bullets, make them substantial (not single words)
- Avoid nested bullets when possible

### Formatting
- Bold for emphasis, not decoration
- Don't bold every other word
- Headers should help navigation, not add fluff

## Quality Check

Before finalizing any content:

1. **Read aloud** - Does it flow naturally?
2. **Pattern scan** - Any tricolons, asyndetic lists, or em-dash contrasts?
3. **Buzzword check** - Any "game-changing" or "revolutionary" hiding?
4. **Specificity test** - Are claims backed by concrete details?
5. **Coffee test** - Would you actually say this to someone?

## Remember

The goal isn't to hide that AI helped write something. The goal is to write well—the way a skilled human writer would. AI patterns are bad because they're lazy writing, not because they reveal AI involvement.

Good writing is good writing. These rules help you get there.
